# Templates

My templates, I share them for demo purposes, and I don't think you should use
them.

In this spirit, there is no support, I may close your PR without the need to
justify me, or I may never respond.

## Description

- `envsh`: my default `env.sh` file
- `elixir-shell`: just a shell for quickly hacking on project where I can't
  commit a `flake.nix`

## To use

    nix flake init --templates 'github:Mayeu/templates#<template name>'

## Licence

CC0 in case you really need a licence, but I don't think this could be
considered original works, so I don't think a licence is needed.
